How to run the Inotify Daemon Process program in a Unix environment.

Requirements: TCLAP and RudeConfig installed. 
Reminder: Must edit the Watchdir variable in the CONF file to specify the watch folder.

Issue the following commands
1. make 
2. ./Prog5 -d <config file name>

Expected Output to Console:
Starting Program...
Parsing Command Line...
Values found in Command Line:
Daemon process enabled (T/F): true
Configuration File found: cs3377dirmond.conf
Parsing Configuration File...
Values found in Configuration File:
Verbose messages enabled (T/F): trueLog file found: cs3377dirmond.log
Password found: mypassword
Number of versions allowed: 10
Watch Directory found: /home/013/l/la/lag170530/testdir
Log file (cs3377dirmond.log) opened. All further information will be logged in the provided log file.



Outputting the above and going back to console line means the daemon is successfully running in the background and an issue of the ps command will display the daemon process. 
All changes made to the folder specified by Watchdir variable will be listed in the Log file and all backups that are created will be in a .versions sub1folder.
